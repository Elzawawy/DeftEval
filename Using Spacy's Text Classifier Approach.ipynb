    "In this approach, we decided to give **Spacy's amazing Models Pipeline** a shot. Here is a summary of what are spaCy’s models from the [Spacy Docs](https://spacy.io/usage/training#basics):\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are statistical and every “decision” they make is a prediction. This prediction is based on the examples the model has seen during training. To train a model, you first need training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model is then shown the unlabelled text and will make a prediction then we give the model feedback on its prediction in the form of an error gradient of the loss function that calculates the difference between the training example and the expected output. The greater the difference, the more significant the gradient and the updates to our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want the model to come up with a theory that can be generalized across other examples. If you only test the model with the data it was trained on, you’ll have no idea how well it’s generalizing. So, that is why we also need evaluation data to test our model.\n",
